#  Linked List

[[Source](../Sources/DataStructures/LinkedList.swift) | [Tests](../Tests/DataStructuresTests/LinkedListTests.swift) | [Playground](../Playgrounds/LinkedList.playground)]

Data structure consisting of a Linear collection of data elements called *nodes*.

### Characteristics:

- Order is not contiguos in physical memory.
- Each element *points* to the next. 
- Constant time insertion and removal. 

### Operations 

* Push: add a value at front of the list. - Complexity: O(1) 
* Pop: removes value at front of the list. - Complexity: O(1)  

* Append: add a value at the end of the list. - Complexity: O(1) 
* RemoveLast: removes value at the end of the list. - Complexity: O(1) 

* Insert after: add a value after a node of the list. - Complexity: O(1) 
* Remove after: removes value after a node of the list. - Complexity: O(1)
